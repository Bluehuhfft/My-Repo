# Terms & Conditions:
1. You run this program at your own risk, I have not designed this with any bad intentions but it is better to be safe than sorry.
2. All my projects are open-source meaning that you can take a look yourself at the source code, please do so before running.
3. Make modifications at your own risk :) And also, have fun!

# Important (Please Read):
The source code of the '.c' files are already pre-compiled in a folder named 'Executables'. If you wish to make modifications, you will need to recompile the source code. Also, if you get an error while compiling, use '-lm' at the end of the command. EG. "gcc Main.c -o Main.exe -lm". If the error does not resolve, you have done the mistake.
