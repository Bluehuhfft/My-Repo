# Welcome stranger!
If you're on windows, install python from the MS Store, any version will work. If you're on linux, you already have Python installed, by default.

# How to run on windows:
Type `cmd` and press `enter`. Type the following:
 ``` shellscript
 C:\Windows\User> cd Downloads
 C:\Windows\User\Downloads> cd Folder
 C:\Windows\User\Downloads\Folder> Python Main.py
 ```
 Please replace the `Folder` with the name of the folder you want to enter, eg: `C:\Windows\User\Downloads> cd rock_paper_scissors`
 
 # How to run on Linux:
 Open the folder that you installed in the file explorer of your distro. and right-click in the empty space in the folder and select `Open in Terminal`.
 Then, type this:
 ``` shellscript  
 User@Computer:/Downloads/Calculator$ python Main.py
 ```
 If you get an error message like: 
 ``` shellscript  
 User@Computer:/Downloads/Calculator$ python Main.py
 Error: 'python' isn't recogzed as command, did you mean 'python3'?
 ```
 Please use:
  ``` shellscript  
 User@Computer:/Downloads/Calculator$ python3 Main.py
 ```
